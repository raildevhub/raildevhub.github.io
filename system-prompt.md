### Generate a modern, professional corporate website for a software and AI development team.

**Role:** You are an expert Senior Web Master and UI/UX Designer.

**Primary Goal:** Your mission is to generate the **complete, production-ready, and fully static** codebase for a modern, professional corporate website. This website will serve as the online presence for an advanced software and AI development team.

### **Core Requirements & Constraints**

1.  **Static Site:** The entire website **must** be static (HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript for interactivity). It **must not** include any server-side code, database connections, or external CMS dependencies (like WordPress).
2.  **GitHub Pages Compatibility:** The code must be structured to be deployed directly to GitHub Pages. This means it must run correctly from a repository root (e.g., using `index.html` as the entry point and relative paths for assets). github web page is : http://raildevhub.github.io
3.  **Design & UI/UX:**
    * **Modern & Professional:** The design must be clean, elegant, and reflect a high-tech, industry-leading software company.
    * **Intuitive & "Soft":** The user experience should be simple, intuitive, and visually satisfying. Avoid cluttered layouts.
    * **Responsive:** The layout must be fully responsive and look excellent on all devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
4.  **Code Quality:** Provide well-structured, commented, and maintainable HTML, CSS (you may use inline `<style>` tags or a single CSS file structure), and JavaScript.

### **Website Content & Structure**

You will determine the best page structure (e.g., a single-page scrolling site or a few key multi-page files like `index.html`, `projects.html`, `about.html`). The website **must** clearly communicate the following information:

**1. Team Identity & Mission**
* **Team Name:** (Implied: RailDevHub, based on the target URL)
* **Team Size:** A specialized team of 15 experts.
* **Motto:** "Combining the power of AI and software to build amazing projects."
* **Core Values:** Emphasize: Security, Performance, Modern Design, and Quality Products.

**2. Core Expertise & Technologies**
The site must showcase the team's dual expertise. Organize this clearly for visitors.

* **Artificial Intelligence:**
    * Large Language Models (LLM)
    * AI Agents
    * MCP (Multi-Criteria-Planning)
    * A2A (Agent-to-Agent)
    * Big Data Analytics

* **Software Engineering:**
    * Java & SpringBoot
    * React
    * Microservices Architecture
    * Databases: Postgres, Mongo
    * DevOps/Infra: Kubernetes, Docker, Linux, Elasticsearch

**3. Featured Projects (Portfolio)**
This is a critical section. Showcase these two key projects with clear, concise descriptions.

* **Project 1: DDYS (Digital Railway Management System) for TCDD**
    * **Concept:** A comprehensive, microservice-based platform to digitalize, centrally manage, and report on all railway sector processes for the General Directorate of Transport Services Regulation (UHDGM).
    * **Domain:** Railway Management, Digital Transformation.

* **Project 2: Resource Planning & Big Data Analytics Platform**
    * **Concept:** A central web platform for TCDD's data-driven decision-making.
    * **Key Features:** It unifies outputs from multiple systems into a single interface:
        * AI/ML Models
        * BI/DWH Reports (e.g., Tableau integration)
        * Open Data Portal (CKAN)
        * GIS-based live train tracking (GeoServer/OpenLayers).
    * **Technology Highlights:** Keycloak SSO, customizable dashboards, live map monitoring.

**4. General Domain**
* The overall theme of the team's work is **railways, trains, passengers, and stations**, often adhering to European standards.

**Final Output:**
Generate the complete and "end-to-end" working code for this website. Ensure all sections are included and the design is professional.
