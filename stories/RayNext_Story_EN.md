# RayNext: The Future of Digital Railway

## The RayNext Story

A journey that begins from the heart of Turkey, Ankara... A vision crossing Istanbul's bridges... The story of a digital transformation rising above thousands of kilometers of railway networks.

**RayNext** is not just a name; it's the symbol of our first step in the digital transformation of the railway sector.

## Why RayNext?

In the modern world of technology, a name must represent both the past and point to the future. **RayNext** strikes exactly this balance:

- **Ray** (Rail): The soul of railways, the history flowing over steel rails for centuries, respect for Turkey's railway culture
- **Next**: Vision for the future, continuous progress, the next phase of digital transformation

This name reminds us: We step into the future while respecting the legacy of the past.

## Our Story

The General Directorate of Transportation Services Regulation (UHDGM) is Turkey's most important authority in the railway sector. From the center of Ankara, this institution, spreading to all corners of the country, is responsible for managing thousands of kilometers of railway networks.

However, in the digital age, traditional methods were falling short. Paper applications, manual processes, scattered systems... This is where **RayNext** was born.

### A Vision Starting from Ankara

In the capital Ankara, a team gathered at the UHDGM building and decided to digitalize the railway sector. Not just software, but a complete ecosystem would be built.

From type approval processes to vehicle registration; from ECM management to safety certificates; from training centers to train driver management... Everything would be digitalized.

### Inspiration from Istanbul

Istanbul, the city that connects two continents. With its thousands of years of history, this city that blends modern technology inspired our project. Just like the bridge between two continents, **RayNext**, built by **PiA Group**, constructs the bridge between traditional and digital.
